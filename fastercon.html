              <p class="desc">FASTERCon is an annual networking conference for Filipino Americans in STE(A)M, <br>
                co-hosted by UC Berkeley’s student-run organizations and FASTER Professionals. The <br>
                conference gathers over 200 attendees each year, from top tech companies to local <br>
                startups.</p>
              <p class="desc">I worked on various designs for marketing the event including a virtual character, a <br>
                12-page print program, banners, and giveaways.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Concept Idea</h1>
              <p class="desc">When I first started working with FASTER in 2017, the network highly centered around <br>
                Silicon Valley tech. The goal was to create a hi-tech feel through electronic-style <br>
                graphics and incorporate the tech atmosphere in the theme. Using computer chips <br>
                and robots as thematic elements brought about consistent branding that is easily <br>
                applicable across different media.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <h1 class="title">Birth of Oso (The Bear)</h1>
              <p class="desc">One of the main goals is to market the conference innovatively using unique visual <br>
                representation. At first, I came across the idea of a bear character as just a design <br>
                element on a FB event cover I had made. Erin, FASTER’s founder and event organizer, <br>
                liked the bear a lot that she wanted to put them on all the marketing designs. <br>
                Eventually, the “FASTER Bear” became almost like a logo for FASTERCon (I had <br>
                secretly named the bear Oso -- Tagalog word for “bear”). I had the most fun making <br>
                this character, and seeing Oso printed on stickers and keychains made me proud.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Brand Expansion</h1>
              <p class="desc">Recently, FASTER has undergone major changes. The organization expanded to <br>
                include not just Silicon Valley tech pros, but all those interested in STE(A)M across <br>
                the nation (now branching out to New York). With this change, I extended the design <br>
                to be more inclusive of other fields.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Increasing Visibility</h1>
              <p class="desc">FASTERCon needed designs for social media marketing. The goal was to create a <br>
                banner that attracts attention as people scroll through their feeds. By using bright <br>
                colors and highlighting the FASTER Bear, the banner was difficult to ignore.</p>

              <p class="desc">For the day of the event, a simple physical banner was designed with the same <br>
                theme as the digital. The banner was posted outside the venue as a signpost.</p>

              <p class="desc">The event included speaker sessions, Q&A panel, workshops and networking <br>
                activities. For this, I designed a 12-page printed pamphlet to inform attendees about <br>
                event logistics (schedule, speakers, sponsors, etc.). If attendees missed <br>
                announcements or arrived in the middle of the day, they will always know what is <br>
                going on, where to go, and who are on stage.</p>

              <p class="desc">The work was done remotely, and sometimes communication via emails do not get <br>
                ideas across as smoothly as face-to-face discussions. There could have been clearer <br>
                conversations when specifying requirements, especially for the pamphlet. Sometimes <br>
                I received sponsor logos that had low resolution, or bios that were either too short or <br>
                too long. The experience has taught me to be better at planning ahead by designing <br>
                flexibly for these situations.</p>

              <p class="desc">I learned how to adjust my designs according to the client’s wants and needs. As a <br>
                student, I usually have creative freedom when designing for student organizations or <br>
                for personal pursuits. Working with FASTER was my first time collaborating with <br>
                industry professionals, and I learned that there are limitations when working with <br>
                people who have different ideas. Ultimately, I learned the importance of designing for <br>
                others.</p>
