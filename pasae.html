              <p class="desc">PASAE is an on-campus organization at UC Berkeley aimed towards providing <br>
                academic, professional, and social support to Filipino American students in STE(A)M. <br>
                Activities include career workshops, panel discussions, networking, and more.</p>
              <p class="desc">I lead the team that held all media relations, including but not limited to online <br>
                content and promotional merchandise. I also designed event banners, flyers, business <br>
                cards, apparel, stickers, and more.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Cover Designs</h1>
              <p class="desc">For each event, PASAE needed Facebook cover designs targeted towards club <br>
                members and other students. The main idea was to capture attention as people <br>
                scroll through their feeds. Additionally, it is important to share the general <br>
                information in the image so that people can quickly decide if they are interested and <br>
                click on the event link. One concern is that Facebook adjusts the image in different <br>
                sizes depending on the device, so I made sure that the text is always in the center. <br>
                This way, the most important information will always be seen.</p>

              <p class="desc">It is important to create a sense of unity and belonging to build close-knit <br>
                relationships. For that reason, I carefully designed team wear each semester, taking <br>
                into account what type and color of clothing the members liked.</p>

                members to share contact information with professionals for potential collaborations. <br>
                The first official PASAE business cards were made using our logo colors.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Obstacles</h1>
              <p class="desc">Not too long ago, PASAE’s website suffered with little views and activity. At one point, <br>
                the previous webmaster stopped updating it with new content. As lead of the <br>
                creative team, I had to find ways to recover the dying website. I tried to communicate <br>
                with the webmaster about the need for newer content, but there was still no <br>
                progress. The hardest part was needing to let go of a staff member. I and the other <br>
                execs handled the situation carefully and made sure both sides parted agreeably. <br>
                After finding a new webmaster, our team thought of ways we can make the website <br>
                more interactive and useful. With these ideas executed by the new webmaster, <br>
                we increased the site’s views significantly.</p>

              <p class="desc">Being part of PASAE for 3 years, I learned the key aspects of managing an <br>
                organization from the inside out. Taking on a leadership role has taught me to voice <br>
                my thoughts and ideas more confidently. This also means working out the differences <br>
                of each member and fostering an environment where everyone feels valuable.</p>
