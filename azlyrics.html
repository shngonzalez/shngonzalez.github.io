              <p class="desc">AZLyrics is a popular website where users can find song lyrics. Its outdated design <br>
                and unintuitive features call for restructuring from the ground up.</p>
              <p class="desc">For this website redesign, I created a prototype that converts AZLyrics to a modern <br>
                website highlighting its searching function. Out of approx. 100 students, my team <br>
                ranked in the top 5 for the class project competition.</p>

              <p class="desc">This is the first website prototype I created as part of the Web Design DeCal, which is <br>
                the class that inspired me to pursue web development. I worked in a three-person <br>
                team to redesign 4 pages of AZLyrics: Home, Search, Artist and Lyrics views. I was in <br>
                charge of the navigation bar, the home page, and the lyrics view.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Finding a Theme</h1>
              <p class="desc">We decided to aim for a dark Spotify-like theme, going with a grey background with a <br>
                hint of bright colors to highlight content. Choosing a blue-green gradient as an accent <br>
                color amplified the music atmosphere we wanted.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Polishing Wireframes</h1>
              <p class="desc">After deciding the theme, I created a mood board consisting of design elements that <br>
                matched the theme. Based on those, I designed wireframes in Adobe XD and coded it <br>
                in HTML. I talked to the instructor for feedback, and fixed the wireframes accordingly.</p>

          <!-- Keeping "A to Z" -->

            <div class="container">
              <h1 class="title">Keeping "A to Z"</h1>
              <p class="desc">The first problem I encountered was deciding whether to keep the A to Z list or not. <br>
                In the original design, there is a list of clickable buttons from A to Z in the navigation <br>
                bar listing artist names that start with that letter. It felt a little unintuitive to use. <br>
                Afterall, the website’s main function is for searching lyrics that the user is already <br>
                familiar with. However, my teammates and I agreed to keep the A to Z because the <br>
                website is named “AZ” Lyrics. For trademark reasons, this feature remains on the <br>
                navigation bar.</p>
              <!-- <img src="assets/images/work/fastercon/">(Animation-M: Old navigation bar with hovering A to Z)
              <p class="caption">Original design</p> -->
              <p class="desc">However, I still wanted to improve the A to Z function. To do so, it had to be more <br>
                subtle yet interactive. The font color is now a lighter grey, with the hovering effect <br>
                changing its color to a bright blue-green shade. Having this contrast increased visual <br>
                feedback to the user. A little change can increase interactivity.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Uncluttering the Homepage</h1>
              <p class="desc">AZLyrics’ main function is searching for lyrics, so the search bar should be the thing <br>
                popping out of the homepage. Instead, AZLyrics’ homepage is cluttered with the <br>
                “What’s Hot” feature, and the search bar barely catches the user’s eyes.</p>

                <p class="caption">AZ Lyrics’ original design</p> -->
              <p class="desc">I decided to remove the “What’s Hot” section to highlight the search bar. For users <br>
                who’d rather have the feature, they can search the album titles seen in the <br>
                background. This way, the clutter is cleared, and the user is pushed to focus on the <br>
                site’s main function: searching.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Readability and Function</h1>
              <p class="desc">The lyrics view was simple and straightforward. I focused on readability and <br>
                interactivity. I increased the contrast between the text and the background and <br>
                added more space in between the lines.</p>
                <!-- <img src="assets/images/work/fastercon/">(Photo-M: Lyrics view) -->
              <p class="desc">A common problem when viewing lyrics is that people tend to lose track of where <br>
                they are. To solve this, I added a hovering effect to highlight lines as people read/sing <br>
                along.</p>
                <!-- <img src="assets/images/work/fastercon/">(Animation-M: Lyrics view zoomed in on highlight effect animation) -->
              <p class="desc">AZLyrics also lacked useful features frequently found in lyric websites: printing, liking, <br>
                and sharing the lyrics. I added these features in a little block on the side, which <br>
                follows along the page as the user scrolls through.</p>

              <p class="desc">Working with other designers demanded that we all know which color, spacing, and <br>
                size guidelines to follow so that the whole product looks consistent. In the end, we <br>
                all used different numbers and the product had varying spacings and sizes. It was <br>
                obvious that each page was designed separately.</p>
              <p class="desc">From this experience, I learned the importance of setting up common design <br>
                guidelines before starting a team project to make sure that everyone in the group is <br>
                on the same page.</p>
